- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. This means using proper naming conventions, commenting your code, and avoiding unnecessary complexity. It also means understanding the trade-offs between different algorithms and data structures, and choosing the right ones for your specific use case. Finally, it means testing your code thoroughly and regularly, and being open to feedback and suggestions from others."
